This is a simple console-based game like old style tamagotchi. The whole project is written in python.

It's used socket to make connection amid the clients and the servers. This project is very simple and can be run also on computers connected to internet by old V.90 modems ( 56kb/s ).

The configuration files are stored into the server and everyone has access to this server can read these files, so pay attention.

There is no SSL connection, everything will be sent clear, the login password is sent in hash MD5.

That's all, I hope you like it and share it.

Personal Motto:

    PyGotchi, new python made, old gotchi game.
