= Introduction =

Here I'll explain how set the server.


= Step 1 =

After you downloaded server file you have to make a new folder called pygotchi, here: */home/pygotchi/*. Now, run the server by root.
{{{
bughardy@cryptolab:~$ sudo mkdir /home/pygotchi
bughardy@cryptolab:~$ sudo python server_0.1.py
}}}

= Step 2 =

Now the server asks you if you need set the conf files and folders, do that only if this is your first time. 
{{{
bughardy@cryptolab:~$ sudo python server_0.1.py 
Do you need to configure the server? [y]: y
New  Folders are going to be created

please select the path: /home/bughardy/pygotchi/
}}}
*NOTE, the folder /home/youruser/pygotchi/ needs to be created.*

= Step 3 =

Now the server if conf. you don't need to set it anymore, a conf file will be saved in */home/pygotchi/*.
Remember that the server needs to be runned by root.

= LOGs =

The server show you live the logs.
